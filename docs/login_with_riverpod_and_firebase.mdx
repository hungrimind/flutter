This is the ***work in progress*** 2.0 course. If you bought the first one, or are thinking of buying the first one, this one is also included!

While the 1.0 version of the course was great, my goal for Hungrimind is to make it the best place online to learn Flutter. So I have been re-engineering the whole site to allow for building a more custom experience.

The 40% off coupon will expire once this course is finished. So I recommend you buy or subscribe now, and get a quality course in return, and then come back once this is finished and get an even better course. Kind of like a 2 for 1 deal ðŸ˜Š

## What Will Be New
Instead of everything as a lump sum, the course will be organized by sections based on topics. When you come back to the course it will be easier to find what you were working on, and it will even have a progress bar for motivation. This will be less overwhelming and more interactive to take. And a little bit more on that second point. 

The course should be more interactive, each page is treated as it's own web page, and I can add components and even interactive exercises right within the course. This probably won't be necessary for most lessons, but when complex topics need deeper explanations, the capabilities will be there.

## Progress Updates

July 20th - Updated how the site works to even have a `courses` sections. 

### Next Steps: 
- Add `Next`, `Previous` buttons
- Create backend to track progress
- Display progress bar, and return user to the last session they left off
