Most big applications need a login system. Most of the apps I have built need the user to login. And once the user is logged in, apps usually use their information everywhere to individualize their app experience, as well as be a crucial data piece for most things within the app. 

This makes the login flow once of the most crucial components of most of the applications. This course covers the most up to date login flow process for a flutter application. This includes using **State Management, Authentication, and User Data Storage.**

It is built with **scalability** and **robustness** in mind and covers everything from the basics of forms, to signing a user in, to going deep into the concept of providers and how to think about bringing state management into your login flow.

In the end you will have a fully built login flow that automatically retrieves the most recent user data from Firestore based on their authentication state.

## Forms with Validation
When submitting information to Firebase, you want to make sure the user entered valid information. In this course we will check that they are using a safe password, and that the email they entered is a valid email using **Regex**.

## Firebase Responsive Authentication
We will listen to any changes with our authentication state, and our app will respond accordingly if anything changes.

## New Riverpod Solution
We will use the newest `NotifierProvider` and `AsyncNotifierProvider` from Riverpod and an authentication stream from firebase that is synced up with the user data from firestore, so users can have the safest and most seamless experience.

At the end you will have a fully safe login flow that you can use as a starting point for your own apps.
