## Keychain Sharing Error
A recent Apple update now requires you to use keychain sharing when using an authentication service. To solve this go to your XCode project and select `Signing & Capabilities`. 

Click `+ Capability` and add `Keychain Sharing`. Then once it's added click the plus button to add your app to sharing.

## MacOS Network Error
When debugging a MacOS project and trying to access anything on the web, you might run into a networking error. This is because by default MacOS projects don't let you do client side requests from the debugger. You can turn this on to allow requests in XCode under `Signing & Capabilities`.
