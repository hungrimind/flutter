## Use Dart Data Class Generator
I personally don't like code generators, but they do save a lot of time writing boilerplate code. However, you can mitigate some of that by using the Dart Data Class Generator extension for VSCode. This lets you create copyWith, toJson, fromJson, and may other helpful methods.

## MacOS Network Error
When debugging a MacOS project and trying to access anything on the web, you might run into a networking error. This is because by default MacOS projects don't let you do client side requests from the debugger. You can turn this on to allow requests in XCode under `Signing & Capabilities`.
