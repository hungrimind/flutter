<div class="font-bold text-purple-400 dark:text-purple-300 text-2xl">The best place to learn Flutter online (at least that's the goal).</div>

This will be done through a collection of blogs, videos, and courses all in the same place. The blogs and videos are open-source, and have open-source demo code to go along with them. 

You can learn all the topics for free and when you're ready to put it together subscribe to <b class="text-lg font-bold">Hungrimind</b><span class="bg-purple-400 mb-4 text-white font-semibold mr-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded ml-2">PRO</span>, where you will get access to the <b>Build</b> section of the site that includes project based courses that will guide you in building robust and scalable solutions as well as give you access to the all the code, and any course materials that come with it.



To do that, make sure you are signed in, and there will be a big <b class="text-lg font-bold">Hungrimind</b><span class="bg-purple-400 mb-4 text-white font-semibold mr-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded ml-2">PRO</span>button at the top. 

See you there!


## Why I Built Hungrimind?
My name is Tadas, in 2020 I started teaching on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/@tadaspetra). While I love creating educational videos, there are some real **BIG** issues with educational YouTube videos. 

## The Problem 
Once videos are released, they are not:

- Editable
- Accountable
- Structured

Which leads to comments like these:

![YouTube comment saying video is outdated](/images/hungrimind_2.png)

### Problems with Tutorials on YouTube
* When there is a new software release, a lot of your content becomes out of date. 
* Even though the YouTube algorithm is pretty good, searching for a small, specific concept within a video is hard. 
* If you make a mistake, it is reeaaallly hard to fix it.
* YouTube has chapters and playlists, but you still can't structure your lessons exactly how you want.

## The Solution
This is what Hungrimind was built for! I want this to be the best place for people to learn Flutter, and you can be sure that the content here is accurate and up to date. 

Each page has an "Edit this page" button that leads to GitHub to flag a problem, update wording, or offer a suggestion. And there is a whole community, including me, ready to fix it up.

Videos will be embedded within the blogs, and while new videos might be created on [Hungrimind Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@hungrimind), **this site will be the source of truth and only the up to date videos will be shown here.**

You can sign up to the newsletter and receive emails every time new content is launched!

This is going to be a long and big project, but I hope and believe that it will become the best resource for learning online.
