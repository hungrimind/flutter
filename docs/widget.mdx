A `Widget` is the fundamental building block of Flutter. There is even a saying in the Flutter community that _everything_ is a Widget. But what does that mean, and how does it work?

## Two Types of Widgets
In Flutter there are 2 types of widgets that you can use. `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`. Now there are some smart people on the Flutter team, and you can see that they chose these names carefully. I bet you know the difference between the two without me even having to explain it. 

`StatelessWidget`s are **State-Less** while `StatefulWidget`s are **State-Full**. The first one doesn't have a `State` associated with it, while the second one definitely does. But what is a State?

### What is a State?
The simple version is that the state is just data that can be changed (within a widget). If you are just displaying something to the user that cannot be altered, like some static text in your app, that does **NOT** have any state. But if you were displaying a counter that can be triggered to count up or down within your application, that count value would be considered your state.

## Stateless Widgets
So `StatelessWidget` does not contain any state. You are simply adding it into the <a href="/flutter/widget_tree">Widget Tree</a> of your application to display something. And what it looks like depends on the configuration of the widget itself and the <a href="/flutter/buildcontext">BuildContext</a>. Some examples of StatelessWidgets are `Text`, `ListTile`, and `FlutterLogo`.
 
Although a `StatelessWidget` can't change, it can be completely rebuilt (which is a normal thing that happens in a Flutter app all the time). It can be built or rebuilt in 3 different situations. 
1. The very first time it was built.
2. If it's parent widget changes.
3. If your widget depends on an InheritedWidget, whenever that changes.

## Stateful Widgets
StatefulWidgets are themselves immutable, just like StatelessWidgets, but they hold a separate State object which is created by calling the `createState` method. 

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyHomePage({
    super.key,
  });
  @override
  State<MyHomePage> createState() => _MyHomePageState();
}
```

Each StatefulWidget comes with 2 classes. First the `StatefulWidget` itself and then a `State` widget which holds the `build` method and all the logic. 

Within this `State`, you can add variables (aka the data or "state") that can be manipulated. And every time it is manipulated, if you want to trigger a rebuild so that your app UI gets updated, you do that using `setState`. 

So along with all the options we had to rebuild a `StatelessWidget`, we have one more option of rebuilding here, which is by manually causing it to update, whenever your data changes.

Whenever you create a flutter project the started application is a counter app with a very simple `StatefulWidget` that increments the counter. Whenever you press the `+` icon, the `_counter` value is incremented and `setState` is called to trigger a rebuild of the `StatefulWidget` and you see the counter value change.

> #### Side Note
> There are ways to update your UI automatically, usually using State Management. But this might still use setState under the hood.


## Under the hood
To understand what's really going on under the hood of `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` we have to go back to the <a href="/flutter/widget_tree">Widget Tree</a>. A Widget Tree is a tree of widgets that defines a blueprint for how your application should look and behave. The Element Tree and the Render Tree are using that blueprint to actually implement those looks and behaviors.

The difference between `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget` can be found in the Element Tree.

The Element Tree is in charge of the location and state of the widget. You can read more about that in the <a href="/flutter/buildcontext#deep-dive">BuildContext</a> doc. So while `StatelessWidget`s just create an `Element` in the Element Tree, `StatefulWidget`s create an `Element` and an associated state with that `Element`. And understanding this will be important when using <a href="/flutter/keys">Keys</a>.
