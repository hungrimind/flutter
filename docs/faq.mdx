## How to unsubscribe?
I really despise software that makes the unsubscribe process difficult. If you choose to unsubscribe, there is a **simple button in the settings** page that will do that **automatically**. No emailing anybody. No long flow that makes you feel bad for doing it. It's as simple and easy as it gets.
